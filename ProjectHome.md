Primes are usually generated by testing random numbers for primality
using a randomized prime test (the most popular being the Miller-Rabin
test).  But these tests do not guarantee that the number is prime,
only make it arbitrarily likely.

If we know the factorization of $p-1$ where $p$ is prime, it is
possible to generate a certificate showing the primality of $p$. This
cannot be used to show that a randomly chosen number is prime, but we
can instead generate the prime ``bottom up'' in a recursive way.

By choosing the sizes of the factors of $p-1$ carefully the generated
primes can have an almost uniform distribution. This is of course
important if the primes are used for cryptographic purposes.

This is asymptotically almost as fast as using a Miller-Rabin test for
generating primes of size $n$.

We describe some details of this way of constructing primes, give an
implementation of the algorithm, measure it, and compare it to
generating primes using the Miller-Rabin primality test.
